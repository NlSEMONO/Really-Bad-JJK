# Really Bad JJK (Revamped)
This is a revamped version of my JJK game from Gr. 12 CS. I created this program to practice the MVC software design technique. 

## Downloading and Running
See https://github.com/NlSEMONO/Code-projects/blob/main/Java/README.md

## Gameplay
1. Once the .jar file is running, there is a tutorial mode option. During the tutorial mode, the user will recieve instructions on how to play the game (ie. moving your character, fighting monsters, what each tile does).
2. In summary: <br>
	WASD - movement (map screen) <br>
	Q - Divergent fist <br>
	A - Basic attack (battle screen) <br>
	E - toggle tile skipping (map screen), Black Flash (battle screen) <br>
 <br>
	Special battle attacks require sufficient energy <br>
 <br>
	Cannot walk into trees <br>
	Buildings heal you <br>
	Water kills you <br>
 <br>
	Win by defeating all monsters <br>
